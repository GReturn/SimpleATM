# SimpleATM
Also called Bong ATM. A run-of-the-mill project by Lindrew (G Return) to help him get started with programming. Its creation first started in July 21, 2020. Simple ATM's description should be self-explanatory, but for the sake of abiding to Github conventions, I will explain it.

Simple ATM grasps the basic concept and mechanism of most modern-day ATMs. It is capable of accepting withdrawals, deposits, and the checking of the clients' amount in their account via WinForms.

That's all. lmao.

### Update / Additional Info:
It's buggy.
